 ######Creating a branch#####
--first create a folder where you want to clone the Repo.
-- cd into the folder

--clone the repo
Git clone (path- use shh for bash and https for powershell and cmd)
1.
-- cd into the cloned folder that is your master branch
2.
-- do a git pull to get latest code
git pull
3.
-- create a branch and also checkout at the same time
git checkout -b <branchname>

---Create a feature branch from an existing branch
-- ensure you are on the branch from which you want to create the feature branchgi
git checkout -b feature/<feature-branch-name> <existing-branch-name>



--Once you do your changes then add the changes in current folder or mention the file names
git add .

-- to commit from staging area to
git commit -m 'your comment here'

---to add to staging area and commit at the same time use
git commit -am 'your comment here'

-- push the branch to repo
git push origin branchname


#### Merge Branch to Master / Main ####
Assuming that you are in branch testBranch and you want to merge the changes with the master,

--First checkout to master branch,
git checkout master

--Now pull the latest changes in master,
git pull origin master

--Merge with the testBranch
git merge testBranch

--Push the changes to master
git push origin master

That's it, you are done.

--delete a branch
checkout to master then
git branch --delete <branchname>
-- Force Delete branch
git branch -D <branchname>

--check branches
git branch -a

---create a branch of existing branch
git checkout -b myFeature dev
Creates the MyFeature branch off dev. Do your work and then

git commit -am "Your message"                 

--difference between two branches ( two dots between the branches)
git diff branch1..branch2

---merge from main in to your current working branch. You are in your current branch
git fetch
git merge origin/main
